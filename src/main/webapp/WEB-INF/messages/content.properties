ra.intro=This software analyzes OSM relations for gaps. This is useful for the cycling routes that are currently being surveyed.<p>At the same time you can extract a relation as a GPX file for your GPS device. This only makes sense if the relation is in one piece.<p>In the current version it is also possible to extract the relation as a KML file and show it on Google Maps or view it directly on OpenStreetMap.<p>If you don't have a relation ID at hand, you can try <a href="analyze.jsp?relationId=12320">12320</a>. It is the "Neckartal-Radweg". I mapped the section from Bessigheim to Neckargem&uuml;nd, where it is due to this program in one piece now ;)<p><b>New</b>: Since version 0.8 support for relation roles has been added. Every role is checked separately. This function is early stage atm. Any feedback is appreciated.
ra.search.intro=Since API 0.6 only a search on a local copy of the OSM data is possible. You can use wildcards (*) in your query. The local copy is generated weekly from the file relations-latest.osm.bz2 from the planet server. 
ra.warning=Please be patient. Downloading data from OSM Server can take up to a minute. <b>API 0.6</b> in use.
ra.search.refer=
ra.using.cache=Using cached data from OSM server for relation. Click [<a href="analyze.jsp?relationId={0,number,#}&useCache=false">reload</a>] to fetch fresh data from OSM server.
ra.warning.includes.relations=This relation contains other relations as members. This analyzer can't handle this at the moment.
ra.warning.self.contained=This relation is closed (self contained).
ra.relation.length=Relation length ca.: 
ra.unconnected.segments=Unconnected segments: 
ra.in.one.piece=Great! The relation is in one piece!!
ra.segments.gaps=List of segments and gaps:
ra.distance.to.next=Distance to next Segment ca.:
ra.segment.self.contained=This Segment is closed (self contained).
ra.segment.roundabout.start=This Segment starts with a roundabout.
ra.segment.roundabout.end=This Segment ends with a roundabout.
ra.relation.not.found=Relation ID not found or relation does not contain ways! The relation might be to large as well.
ra.notes=Notes:<ul><li>Sometimes segments are very close but are not connected. Check if there are two nodes at almost the same position. Merge them if possible.</li><li>Mapping an alternative route with the same relation might be not a good idea. Some mappers create an extra relation only for the alternative parts. Those relations won't be connected of course.</li><li>Some routes may appear as connected on the cycle map, but not all ways are part of the relation. Some ways may still be tagged with additional tags instead adding them to a relation.</li><li>Sometimes it helps to see the relation in Google Maps. Every segment gets a different color.<li>Roundabouts cannot be recognized as part of a continuous relation at the moment. They are specially marked in the list.</li></ul>
ra.search.tips=Tips on how to improve your search results:<ul><li>Try entering just a part of the name and use wild cards in at the begining and the end, like: <a href="search.jsp?source=local&type=name&value=*radweg*">*radweg*</a></li></ul>
josm.rcintro=<b>NEW!!!</b> Now also supporting the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/RemoteControl" target="_blank">JOSM RemoteControl Plugin</a>. Very recommended for all JOSM users! Nodes closest to the gap will be automatically selected.
ra.multiple.way.per.role=The relation contains the same ways with a role. The amount of ways is displayed after the way ID.
